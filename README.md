## Project Overview

Introduction: 
KulliyyahQuiz is a web-based assessment platform designed for IIUM students and lecturers. The system modernizes the traditional paper-based quiz process by offering a digital, efficient, and user friendly solution. It provides secure login for all users, with different access levels for students, teachers, and administrators.

## Project Objectives
- To enable Teachers to easily create, manage, and publish quizzes, including the addition of various question types (MCQ and True/False) and setting key parameters like start/end times and attempt limits.
- To provide Students with a structured online interface for attempting quizzes, complete with a timer and randomized question order to ensure a standardized testing environment.
- To implement an automatic grading system that instantly calculates and records student scores upon quiz submission, thereby providing immediate feedback to students and reducing the manual workload for instructors.
- To develop a dedicated Teacher dashboard that displays analytics, including quiz attempts, average scores, and class performance, to enable effective monitoring of student progress.
- To design and implement a clear database structure utilizing the specified tables with well-defined Eloquent relationships for efficient data storage and retrieval.
